# Convict Conditioning Tracker

A tracker for the workout in Paul Wade's [Convict Conditioning](http://www.amazon.com/Convict-Conditioning-Weakness-Survival-Strength/dp/0938045768). Convict Conditioning (CC) is well-known for its focus on calisthenics and body-weight exercises, and other "gym-less" workouts.

This website will track a person's progression through the workouts, and will (eventually) print out graphs indicating their journey over time.

As of yet, the website is currently for private use only, as I don't know the copyright implications of supplying something that provides the workout program of a copyrighted workout, but that doesn't mean I can't show off my code.
